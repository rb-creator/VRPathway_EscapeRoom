# Ensure text files are normalized (LF in the repository, CRLF or LF in the working directory depending on the OS)
* text=auto

# Handle line endings for specific file types
*.sh text eol=lf       # Shell scripts should always use LF
*.bat text eol=crlf     # Batch scripts should always use CRLF
*.txt text              # Normalize text files (auto detect)

# Optionally, add rules for other specific file types:
*.cs text eol=lf        # C# files (or any source code) should use LF in the repo
*.js text eol=lf        # JavaScript files should use LF in the repo
*.java text eol=lf      # Java files should use LF in the repo
